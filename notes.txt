- unit tests on -x-straight v8-x-  >> no, just use node.  straight v8 is too bare.
- integration tests on memory engine

apply the same integration suite everywhere?  possible?
 
sql engine
- integration tests that run on node-sqlite (i.e. incorporating node)
- then take those same integration tests and reuse on html5 client side db 
    (in-browser tests [html pages]?  
       what about headless safari?  "run if darwin"  could just be loading an html page and scraping the results, printing to command line (could even poll and puts...use ruby).  use a plain-text jasmine runner.  extract this?)


idea: every time "suite" runs, run this:

http://github.com/codespeaks/modulr

(if it's fast)

and generate an arel-all.js in the root of the project
also a minified arel-all-minified.js?
