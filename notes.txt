set up all the namespaces for a module in one place?

require("arel/attributes/namespace")

- unit tests on -x-straight v8-x-  >> no, just use node.  straight v8 is too bare.
- integration tests on memory engine

apply the same integration suite everywhere?  possible?
 
sql engine
- integration tests that run on node-sqlite (i.e. incorporating node)
- then take those same integration tests and reuse on html5 client side db 
    (in-browser tests [html pages]?  
       what about headless safari?  "run if darwin"  could just be loading an html page and scraping the results, printing to command line (could even poll and puts...use ruby).  use a plain-text jasmine runner.  extract this?)


generate a minified arel-all-minified.js?

idea: jasmine plain-text html runner, plus rubycocoa safari stuff from schnauzer =
  fast command-line browser-based js test run
  ...can the output be seen incrementally?
  target: unit test output looks exactly like command line output
    (failures look the same, etc).
  do it with macruby?

  String likely does not convert false to "false"
