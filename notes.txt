- unit tests on straight v8
- integration tests on memory engine

apply the same integration suite everywhere?  possible?
 
sql engine
- integration tests that run on node-sqlite (i.e. incorporating node)
- then take those same integration tests and reuse on html5 client side db 
    (in-browser tests [html pages]?  
       what about headless safari?  "run if darwin"  could just be loading an html page and scraping the results, printing to command line (could even poll and puts...use ruby).  use a plain-text jasmine runner.  extract this?)
